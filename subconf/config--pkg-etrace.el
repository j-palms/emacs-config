;;
;;  Generated package (no.28) from my config.
;;
;;  This is liable to have unstated dependencies, and reply on other bits of
;;  state from other configuration blocks. Only use this if you know /exactly/
;;  what you are doing.
;;
;;  This may function nicely as a bit of self-contained functionality, or it
;;  might be a horrid mix of functionalities and state.
;;
;;  Hopefully, in future static analysis will allow this to become more
;;  properly package-like.
;;
;;  Package statement:
;;   (package! etrace :recipe (:host github :repo "aspiers/etrace")
;;     :pin "2291ccf2f2ccc80a6aac4664e8ede736ceb672b7")
;;
;;; Code:

(use-package! etrace
  :after elp)

(provide 'config--pkg-etrace)
;;; config--pkg-etrace.el ends here
