;;
;;  Generated package (no.26) from my config.
;;
;;  This is liable to have unstated dependencies, and reply on other bits of
;;  state from other configuration blocks. Only use this if you know /exactly/
;;  what you are doing.
;;
;;  This may function nicely as a bit of self-contained functionality, or it
;;  might be a horrid mix of functionalities and state.
;;
;;  Hopefully, in future static analysis will allow this to become more
;;  properly package-like.
;;
;;  Package statement:
;;   (package! aas :recipe (:host github :repo "ymarco/auto-activating-snippets")
;;     :pin "566944e3b336c29d3ac11cd739a954c9d112f3fb")
;;
;;; Code:

(use-package! aas
  :commands aas-mode)

(provide 'config--pkg-aas)
;;; config--pkg-aas.el ends here
