;;
;;  Generated package (no.13) from my config.
;;
;;  This is liable to have unstated dependencies, and reply on other bits of
;;  state from other configuration blocks. Only use this if you know /exactly/
;;  what you are doing.
;;
;;  This may function nicely as a bit of self-contained functionality, or it
;;  might be a horrid mix of functionalities and state.
;;
;;  Hopefully, in future static analysis will allow this to become more
;;  properly package-like.

;;; Code:

(setq which-key-idle-delay 0.5) ;; I need the help, I really do
(setq which-key-allow-multiple-replacements t)
(after! which-key
  (pushnew!
