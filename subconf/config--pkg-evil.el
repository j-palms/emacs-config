;;
;;  Generated package (no.17) from my config.
;;
;;  This is liable to have unstated dependencies, and reply on other bits of
;;  state from other configuration blocks. Only use this if you know /exactly/
;;  what you are doing.
;;
;;  This may function nicely as a bit of self-contained functionality, or it
;;  might be a horrid mix of functionalities and state.
;;
;;  Hopefully, in future static analysis will allow this to become more
;;  properly package-like.
;;
;;; Code:

(after! evil
  (setq evil-ex-substitute-global t     ; I like my s/../.. to by global by default
        evil-move-cursor-back nil       ; Don't move the block cursor when toggling insert mode
        evil-kill-on-visual-paste nil)) ; Don't put overwritten text in the kill ring

(provide 'config--pkg-evil)
;;; config--pkg-evil.el ends here
