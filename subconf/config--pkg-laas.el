;;
;;  Generated package (no.90) from my config.
;;
;;  This is liable to have unstated dependencies, and reply on other bits of
;;  state from other configuration blocks. Only use this if you know /exactly/
;;  what you are doing.
;;
;;  This may function nicely as a bit of self-contained functionality, or it
;;  might be a horrid mix of functionalities and state.
;;
;;  Hopefully, in future static analysis will allow this to become more
;;  properly package-like.
;;
;;  Package statement:
;;   (package! laas :recipe (:host github :repo "tecosaur/LaTeX-auto-activating-snippets"
;;                           :files ("*.el")))
;;
;;; Code:

(use-package! laas
  :hook (LaTeX-mode . laas-mode)
  :config
  (defun laas-tex-fold-maybe ()
    (unless (equal "/" aas-transient-snippet-key)
      (+latex-fold-last-macro-a)))
  (add-hook 'aas-post-snippet-expand-hook #'laas-tex-fold-maybe))

(provide 'config--pkg-laas)
