;;
;;  Generated package (no.58) from my config.
;;
;;  This is liable to have unstated dependencies, and reply on other bits of
;;  state from other configuration blocks. Only use this if you know /exactly/
;;  what you are doing.
;;
;;  This may function nicely as a bit of self-contained functionality, or it
;;  might be a horrid mix of functionalities and state.
;;
;;  Hopefully, in future static analysis will allow this to become more
;;  properly package-like.

(set-file-template! "\\.tex$" :trigger "__" :mode 'latex-mode)

(set-file-template! "/LICEN[CS]E$" :trigger '+file-templates/insert-license)
