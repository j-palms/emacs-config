;;
;;  Generated package (no.40) from my config.
;;
;;  This is liable to have unstated dependencies, and reply on other bits of
;;  state from other configuration blocks. Only use this if you know /exactly/
;;  what you are doing.
;;
;;  This may function nicely as a bit of self-contained functionality, or it
;;  might be a horrid mix of functionalities and state.
;;
;;  Hopefully, in future static analysis will allow this to become more
;;  properly package-like.

;;; Code:

(defface variable-pitch-serif
    '((t (:family "serif")))
    "A variable-pitch face with serifs."
    :group 'basic-faces)
(defcustom variable-pitch-serif-font (font-spec :family "serif")
  "The font face used for `variable-pitch-serif'."
  :group 'basic-faces
  :set (lambda (symbol value)
         (set-face-attribute 'variable-pitch-serif nil :font value)
         (set-default-toplevel-value symbol value)))
