;;
;;  Generated package (no.27) from my config.
;;
;;  This is liable to have unstated dependencies, and reply on other bits of
;;  state from other configuration blocks. Only use this if you know /exactly/
;;  what you are doing.
;;
;;  This may function nicely as a bit of self-contained functionality, or it
;;  might be a horrid mix of functionalities and state.
;;
;;  Hopefully, in future static analysis will allow this to become more
;;  properly package-like.
;;
;;  Package statement:
;;   (package! screenshot :recipe (:host github :repo "tecosaur/screenshot"))
;;
;;; Code:

(use-package! screenshot
  :defer t
  :config (setq screenshot-upload-fn "upload %s 2>/dev/null"))

(provide 'config--pkg-screenshot)
;;; config--pkg-screenshot.el ends here
