;;
;;  Generated package (no.22) from my config.
;;
;;  This is liable to have unstated dependencies, and reply on other bits of
;;  state from other configuration blocks. Only use this if you know /exactly/
;;  what you are doing.
;;
;;  This may function nicely as a bit of self-contained functionality, or it
;;  might be a horrid mix of functionalities and state.
;;
;;  Hopefully, in future static analysis will allow this to become more
;;  properly package-like.

;;; Code:

(setq projectile-ignored-projects
      (list "~/" "/tmp" (expand-file-name "straight/repos" doom-local-dir)))
(defun projectile-ignored-project-function (filepath)
  "Return t if FILEPATH is within any of `projectile-ignored-projects'"
  (or (mapcar (lambda (p) (s-starts-with-p p filepath)) projectile-ignored-projects)))
