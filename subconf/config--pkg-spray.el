;;
;;  Generated package (no.50) from my config.
;;
;;  This is liable to have unstated dependencies, and reply on other bits of
;;  state from other configuration blocks. Only use this if you know /exactly/
;;  what you are doing.
;;
;;  This may function nicely as a bit of self-contained functionality, or it
;;  might be a horrid mix of functionalities and state.
;;
;;  Hopefully, in future static analysis will allow this to become more
;;  properly package-like.
;;
;;  Package statement:
;;   (package! spray :pin "74d9dcfa2e8b38f96a43de9ab0eb13364300cb46")
;;
;;; Code:

(use-package! spray
  :commands spray-mode
  :config
  (setq spray-wpm 600
        spray-height 800)
  (defun spray-mode-hide-cursor ()
    "Hide or unhide the cursor as is appropriate."
    (if spray-mode
        (setq-local spray--last-evil-cursor-state evil-normal-state-cursor
                    evil-normal-state-cursor '(nil))
      (setq-local evil-normal-state-cursor spray--last-evil-cursor-state)))
