;;
;;  Generated package (no.93) from my config.
;;
;;  This is liable to have unstated dependencies, and reply on other bits of
;;  state from other configuration blocks. Only use this if you know /exactly/
;;  what you are doing.
;;
;;  This may function nicely as a bit of self-contained functionality, or it
;;  might be a horrid mix of functionalities and state.
;;
;;  Hopefully, in future static analysis will allow this to become more
;;  properly package-like.
;;
;;; Code:

(require 'julia-mode)

(add-hook 'julia-mode-hook #'rainbow-delimiters-mode-enable)
(add-hook! 'julia-mode-hook
  (setq-local lsp-enable-folding t
              lsp-folding-range-limit 100))

(provide 'config-julia)
;;; config-julia.el ends here
