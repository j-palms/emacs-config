;;
;;  Generated package (no.65) from my config.
;;
;;  This is liable to have unstated dependencies, and reply on other bits of
;;  state from other configuration blocks. Only use this if you know /exactly/
;;  what you are doing.
;;
;;  This may function nicely as a bit of self-contained functionality, or it
;;  might be a horrid mix of functionalities and state.
;;
;;  Hopefully, in future static analysis will allow this to become more
;;  properly package-like.
;;
;;  Package statement:
;;   (package! org-transclusion :recipe (:host github :repo "nobiot/org-transclusion")
;;     :pin "5cb94542e18722bf72a281441e944a8039b5301f")
;;
;;; Code:

(use-package! org-transclusion
  :commands org-transclusion-mode
  :init
  (map! :after org :map org-mode-map
        "<f12>" #'org-transclusion-mode))

(provide 'config--pkg-org-transclusion)
