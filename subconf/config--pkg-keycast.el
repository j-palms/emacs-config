;;
;;  Generated package (no.37) from my config.
;;
;;  This is liable to have unstated dependencies, and reply on other bits of
;;  state from other configuration blocks. Only use this if you know /exactly/
;;  what you are doing.
;;
;;  This may function nicely as a bit of self-contained functionality, or it
;;  might be a horrid mix of functionalities and state.
;;
;;  Hopefully, in future static analysis will allow this to become more
;;  properly package-like.

;;  Package statement:
;;   (package! keycast :pin "72d9add8ba16e0cae8cfcff7fc050fa75e493b4e")

;;; Code:

  :commands keycast-mode
  :config
  (define-minor-mode keycast-mode
    "Show current command and its key binding in the mode line."
