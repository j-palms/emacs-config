;;
;;  Generated package (no.8) from my config.
;;
;;  This is liable to have unstated dependencies, and reply on other bits of
;;  state from other configuration blocks. Only use this if you know /exactly/
;;  what you are doing.
;;
;;  This may function nicely as a bit of self-contained functionality, or it
;;  might be a horrid mix of functionalities and state.
;;
;;  Hopefully, in future static analysis will allow this to become more
;;  properly package-like.
;;
;;; Code:

(map! :n [mouse-8] #'better-jumper-jump-backward
      :n [mouse-9] #'better-jumper-jump-forward)
